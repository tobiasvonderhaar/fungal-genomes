Workflow Pseudocode

1. Setup
    Factors:
      Define factors from literature
      Identify defining motifs and length constraints
    Genomes:
      Recover species names
      Recover genomes
        Recover link bases
2. For each genome:
    For each factor:
      Blast closest experimental factor against genome
      Reverse blast against originating genome to confirm
      Check against defining motifs and length constraints
      Flag for manual attention
      Add to database
3. Manually curate flagged entries
4. Count group gene copy numbers
5. Produce group consensus sequences
